 * Revision 2.29  2003/09/14 19:00:02  wmcoolmon
 * Changed "nospec" and "cell" to "Cmdline_nospec" and "Cmdline_cell"
 *
 * Revision 2.28  2003/09/14 18:32:24  wmcoolmon
 * Added "-safeloading" command line parameter, which uses old fs2_retail-style loading code -C
 *
 * Revision 2.27  2003/09/13 06:02:05  Goober5000
 * clean rollback of all of argv's stuff
 * --Goober5000
 *
 * Revision 2.25  2003/09/09 17:10:54  matt
 * Added -nospec cmd line param to disable specular -Sticks
 *
 * Revision 2.24  2003/08/22 07:35:08  bobboau
 * specular code should be bugless now,
 * cell shadeing has been added activated via the comand line '-cell',
 * 3D shockwave models, and a transparency method I'm calling edge and center alpha that could be usefull for other things, ask for details
 *
 * Revision 2.23  2003/08/21 20:54:37  randomtiger
 * Fixed switching - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.22  2003/08/12 03:18:33  bobboau
 * Specular 'shine' mapping;
 * useing a phong lighting model I have made specular highlights
 * that are mapped to the model,
 * rendering them is still slow, but they look real purdy
 *
 * also 4 new (untested) comand lines, the XX is a floating point value
 * -spec_exp XX
 * the n value, you can set this from 0 to 200 (actualy more than that, but this is the recomended range), it will make the highlights bigger or smaller, defalt is 16.0 so start playing around there
 * -spec_point XX
 * -spec_static XX
 * -spec_tube XX
 * these are factors for the three diferent types of lights that FS uses, defalt is 1.0,
 * static is the local stars,
 * point is weapons/explosions/warp in/outs,
 * tube is beam weapons,
 * for thouse of you who think any of these lights are too bright you can configure them you're self for personal satisfaction
 *
 * Revision 2.21  2003/08/09 06:07:23  bobboau
 * slightly better implementation of the new zbuffer thing, it now checks only three diferent formats defalting to the 16 bit if neither the 24 or 32 bit versions are suported
 *
 * Revision 2.20  2003/03/29 09:42:05  Goober5000
 * made beams default shield piercing again
 * also added a beam no pierce command line flag
 * and fixed something else which I forgot :P
 * --Goober5000
 *
 * Revision 2.19  2003/03/20 08:24:45  unknownplayer
 * Modified the command line options so they are all in lower-case characters.
 * Made a slight AI adjustment to how ships choose to attack turrets (they now have a 25% chance of attacking a beam turret which has fired at them from another ship)
 *
 * Revision 2.18  2003/03/18 10:07:00  unknownplayer
 * The big DX/main line merge. This has been uploaded to the main CVS since I can't manage to get it to upload to the DX branch. Apologies to all who may be affected adversely, but I'll work to debug it as fast as I can.
 *
 * Revision 2.17  2003/02/22 04:13:17  wmcoolmon
 * Added "-dshowvid" command-line option, which must be set in order for movies to play.
 *
 * Revision 2.16  2002/12/21 13:39:25  DTP
 * did bit more house keeping. modfied Phreaks fps cmdline a bit, so that we dont have to specific build code.libs for fred, but can use the same code.lib for both fs2_open.exe and fred2_open.exe
 *
 * Revision 2.15  2002/12/17 03:08:18  DTP
 * fix to Show_framerate. seems it will call an unresolved external error during fred builds. modified my ifndefs a bit, dsw modified to include preprocessor tag FRED.
 *
 * Revision 2.14  2002/12/17 02:22:34  DTP
 * wrong name :)
 *
 * Revision 2.13  2002/12/17 02:21:06  DTP
 * cleaned up after phreak :). it will make a mess in debug builds. added a couple of ifndef _debugs.
 *
 * Revision 2.12  2002/12/14 17:09:08  phreak
 * added a command line that displays frames per second when enabled.
 * use "-fps"
 *
 * Revision 2.11  2002/11/10 16:32:42  DTP
 * -DTP reworked mod support,
 *
 * Revision 2.10  2002/11/10 16:30:53  DTP
 * -DTP reworked mod support,
 *
 * Revision 2.9  2002/10/27 23:55:36  DTP
 * DTP; started basic implementation of mod-support
 * plain files only for now. fs2_open.exe -mod X will look for files in fs2/ X /all-legal-subdirectories. no checking/creating dirs yet. directories must be there.
 *
 * Revision 2.8  2002/10/22 23:02:39  randomtiger
 * Made Phreaks alternative scanning style optional under the command line tag "-phreak"

 * When on is now less blury. - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.4.2.3  2002/11/04 23:53:24  randomtiger
 *
 * Added new command line parameter -d3dlauncher which brings up the launcher.
 * This is needed since FS2 DX8 now stores the last successful details in the registry and
 * uses them to choose the adapter and mode to run in unless its windowed or they are not set.
 * Added some code for Antialiasing but it messes up the font but hopefully that can be fixed later. - RT
 *
 * Revision 2.4.2.2  2002/11/04 21:24:59  randomtiger
 *
 * When running in D3D all ani's are memory mapped for speed, this takes up more memory but stops gametime locking of textures which D3D8 hates.
 * Added new command line tag Cmdline_d3dlowmem for people who dont want to make use of this because they have no memory.
 * Cleaned up some more texture stuff enabled console debug for D3D.
 *
