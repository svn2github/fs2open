In order for Anjuta 1 to function properly with this project file
it must exist in the root of the code tree.  To do this simply copy
or hard link the FS2_Open.prj file down two directories.


Hard link example:
cd ../../
ln projects/anjuta1/FS2_Open.prj

Use the project file from the root of the code tree and changes will
automatically get made to the file in the projects directory.  Do not
link symbolically or Anjuta will use the wrong directory for accessing
files.
