This is still in pretty rough form.


=== for people building fs2_open:

Win32-MSVC:
Use the Freespace2.dsw workspace and build within the IDE.


Win32-MinGW:
  make


Linux and other unix variants (NOT YET COMPLETE)
  ./configure [options]
  make



=== for the project maintainers (people who need to 
=== keep the makefiles up to date) and those building
=== from CVS:

./autogen.sh (should only has to be done once)
./configure [options]
make

automake v1.6.1+ and
autoconf v2.54+ are required
