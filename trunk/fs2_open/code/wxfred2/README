====wxFRED2 - Port of Volition's FReespace EDitor to use wxWidgets GUI libraries====
===Required Libraries===
You must have wxWidgets 2.9.4 or later.

==Visual Studio==
MSVC users may download the headers and binaries directly from the wxWidgets hosts:
- wxWidgets 2.9.4:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/2.9.4/binaries/
- wxWidgets 2.9.5:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/2.9.5/binaries/

Be sure to download the wxWidgets-2.9.X_Headers.7z and the appropriate wxMSW-2.9.X_vcXX_Dev.7z
The vcXX may be:
- vc80  - MSVC 2005
- vc90  - MSVC 2008
- vc100 - MSVC 2010

==Other IDE's==
All other programming environments must compile their libraries from the source. Download from the appropriate "source archive" linked in the page below:
- http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/


===Directory Map===
"/wxfred2/base"
- contains the tool generated files which are derived by all windows, frames, and dialogs found elsewhere in "/wxfred2"

"/wxfred2/editors"
- contains the source code for frames and dialogs listed under the Editors menu in wxFRED2.
- Also includes an XML resource file (".xrc") which may be, and is recommended to be, used by a WYSIWYG editor to edit the GUI elements of wxfred2. At the time of this writing, wxFormBuilder v3.3 - beta proved to be stable enough to create all the elements, although the generated wxFRED2_base.cpp had to be sanitized of deprecated flags in order for it to be compiled under the wxWidgets 2.9.4 lib.

"/wxfred2/help"
- contains the source code for the "About" and help dialogs listed under the Help menu in wxFRED2.

"/wxfred2/misc"
- contains the source code for miscillanious tools listed under the Misc menu in wxFRED2.

"/wxfred2/res"
- contains the resouce files used by wxFRED2 during runtime, these are typically images used for the graphic buttons.


===Importing wxFRED2.xrc into a WYSIWYG Editor===
==wxFormBuilder==
To import wxFRED2.xrc into wxFormBuilder:

 1. Open wxFormBuilder, and create a new project (File->New Project)

 2. Import wxFRED2.xrc (File->Import XRC...)

 3. In the left-hand panel labeled "Object Tree," select the project name at the very top of the tree. You most likely will need to scroll up.

 4. In the right-hand panel labeled "Object Properties," change the properties to the following:
  . Under "Project":
  . name to "wxFRED2" or your name of choice
  . path to "/"
  . embedded_files_path to "../res/"
  . code_generation to "C++, XRC" (check both boxes by expanding the group)

 5. Under "C++ Properties":
  . use_enum to "checked"
  . namespace to "fredBase"
  . event_generation to "table"
  . disconnect_events to "not checked"

==Other WYSIYWG Editors==
Importing into other WYSIWYG editors should be similar to importing into wxFormBuilder. Be sure the options in steps 4 and 5 are set as they are so that for your newly generated files to play nice with the existing "/wxfred2/" code.

Please be sure to NOT include the project file from the WYSIWYG editor in your commits to the fs2_open repo, as they are far larger than the .xrc and are usually specific to that editor!
