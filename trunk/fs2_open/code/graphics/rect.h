 * Cleaned up graphics lib.  Took out most unused gr functions.   Made D3D
 * & Glide have popups and print screen.  Took out all >8bpp software
 * support.  Made Fred zbuffer.  Made zbuffer allocate dynamically to
 * support Fred.  Made zbuffering key off of functions rather than one
 * global variable.
