The FreeSpace Open Installer is the easiest way to install FreeSpace Open, an open-source game
engine, graphical upgrade, and content pack for one of the world's finest space shooters.  You
can use it to install the latest upgrades and enhancements from Hard-Light.net or keep your FSO
installation and mods all up-to-date.

The Installer is known to work on Windows, Linux, and Mac.  More detailed information can be found
on the Hard-Light Wiki (http://www.hard-light.net/wiki/index.php/FreeSpace_Open_Installer).

The Installer requires that you already have a copy of FreeSpace 2 installed.  You can get it from
Good Old Games (http://www.gog.com/game/freespace_2).  After that simply run the Installer!

If you have issues, please post on the FSO Support Forum and we'll help you out!
