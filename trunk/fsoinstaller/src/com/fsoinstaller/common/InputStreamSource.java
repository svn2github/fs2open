	 * This is a callback method to "start over" getting data from an
	 * InputStream. Reading from a 7-Zip file might require seeking backwards,
	 * which is generally not supported in streams. Stream buffers can mitigate
	 * the situation, but they have limited size. This method provides a way for
	 * the stream to be recycled at its source. The stream processor actually
	 * doesn't care whether the stream is a brand new one or the same as the
	 * current one, so long as the stream pointer has been reset to the
	 * beginning.
	 * <p>
	 * The <tt>oldInputStream</tt> parameter will contain the stream that is to
	 * be recycled. If it is not possible for the stream's pointer to be reset,
	 * then the implementing class should close the old stream and open a new
	 * one. A null <tt>oldInputStream</tt> indicates that the stream is being
	 * requested for the first time.
	 * <p>
	 * The <tt>position</tt> parameter indicates the byte index at which the new
	 * stream should begin returning data. If the stream supports random access,
	 * the source should open the stream at the proper position; if not, the
	 * source should seek forward to the position before returning the stream.
	 * Invalid positions should throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
	 * 
	 * @throws IOException if there is a problem creating a new InputStream
	 * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if the position is out of range
